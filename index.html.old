introduction: |
  Greetings, fellow enthusiasts! I'm Erick, an Industrial and Systems Engineer with a diverse background in Organic Agriculture and Food Systems, Automotive Engineering, and Lean Manufacturing. As I venture into the realm of data science and applied research, particularly in the intriguing field of digitizing fish behavior, I am eager to explore the cross-disciplinary connections that foster innovation and growth.

  This website serves as a comprehensive repository of my academic, professional, and personal experiences, showcasing the wealth of knowledge I have amassed through various projects and endeavors. From my time in the Automotive Engineering Master Program and work in lean manufacturing to the lessons learned in a Data Science Bootcamp and my personal adventures in home automation, Docker, and home lab experiments, I aim to provide a transparent account of my progress and a roadmap for future pursuits.

  While my primary objective is to document each step of my journey for my own reference and edification, I warmly invite you to explore and learn alongside me. Together, we can embark on a journey of discovery and growth, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in engineering, agriculture, and data-driven storytelling. Let's uncover the hidden stories that data has to offer and contribute to a sustainable and efficient future.

  Join me at the crossroads of expertise, where innovation thrives and knowledge grows when shared.
